This is a very simple module to localize strings in an Angular page.

It is based on this code: http://blog.novanet.no/creating-multilingual-support-using-angularjs/

The main difference is that the localization service is a module separate from the application module. My goal was to create a completely separate module in order to make it easily reusable.

Usage

To localize your application you only need to proceed as follows:

- Add the file i18n.js to your solution and reference it.
- Reference the i18n module in your application module: app = angular.module('app', ['i18n']);
- Create the i18n folder and add the translation files.

The default language is initialized to en in i18n.js you can change it to fr to see the difference.

Evolution

//add switch language function calling initialize on service with combo in UI.
