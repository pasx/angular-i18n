This is a very simple module to localize strings in an Angular page.

It is based on this code: http://blog.novanet.no/creating-multilingual-support-using-angularjs/

The main difference is that the localization service is a module separate from the application module. My goal was to create a completely separate module in order to make it easily reusable.

Usage

To localize your application you only need to proceed as follows:

- Add the file i18n.js to your solution and reference it.
- Reference the i18n module in your application module: app = angular.module('app', ['i18n']);
- Create the i18n folder and add the translation files.

The default language is initialized to en in i18n.js you can change it to fr to see the difference by editing this line:
   i18nService.initialize($rootScope,'en');
to
   i18nService.initialize($rootScope,'fr');

Evolution

Use cookies to store the default language for the user.

Add a language switch function calling initialize on the service with a combo in the UI.


Directory structure (you will need to add the lib folder and its content):

index.html
-js
  app.js
  i18n.js
-i18n
  i18n_en.json
  i18n_fr.json
-lib
  -angular
    angular.min.js
  -bootstrap
    bootstrap.min.js
-css
  styles.css
